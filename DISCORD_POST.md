## **Core Features**

### 📋 **Three Status System**
TrackFlow organizes your songs into three clear statuses:
- **Future Plans** - Songs you're planning to work on but haven't started yet
- **In Progress (WIP)** - Songs you're actively working on with workflow tracking and progress bars
- **Released** - Completed songs that are finished and published

### 🔧 **Custom Workflows**
Every user has their own custom workflow - customize your authoring process to match exactly how you work:
- Add, remove, and reorder workflow steps
- Choose from predefined templates or create completely custom workflows
- Common steps: Demucs, MIDI extraction, Tempo mapping, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Vocals, Harmonies, Pro Keys, and more
- Drag and drop to arrange steps in your preferred order
- Collaborators automatically use the song owner's workflow
