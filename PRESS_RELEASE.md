# 🎵 TrackFlow - Your Complete Rock Band Authoring Management System

**TrackFlow** is a comprehensive project management system designed for Rock Band custom song authoring. It helps you track your authoring progress, collaborate with other authors, and manage multiple songs and packs efficiently from initial planning through final release.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 📋 Three Status System
TrackFlow organizes your songs into three clear statuses that represent different stages of your authoring process:

- **🗓️ Future Plans** - Songs you're planning to work on but haven't started yet. This is your backlog of ideas and planned projects.
- **⚡ In Progress (WIP)** - Songs you're actively working on with workflow tracking, progress bars, and completion percentages.
- **✅ Released** - Completed songs that are finished and published, representing your completed work and achievements.

### 🔧 Custom Workflows
Every user has their own custom workflow - the specific steps they need to complete for each song. Customize your authoring process to match exactly how you work:

- Add, remove, and reorder workflow steps
- Choose from predefined templates or create completely custom workflows
- Common steps include: Demucs, MIDI extraction, Tempo mapping, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Vocals, Harmonies, Pro Keys, and more
- Drag and drop to arrange steps in your preferred order
- Collaborators automatically use the song owner's workflow, ensuring everyone is aligned

### 🤝 Collaboration
TrackFlow supports both pack-level and song-level collaboration, making it easy to work with other authors:

- **Pack Collaboration** - Share entire packs with collaborators who can see and edit all songs
- **Song Collaboration** - Share individual songs without sharing the entire pack, perfect for specialists working on specific tracks
- **Permission Levels** - View-only or Edit access for fine-grained control
- **Shared Progress** - Everyone can see each other's completion status in real-time
- **Unified Workflow** - All collaborators work with the same workflow as defined by the song owner

### 🎧 Spotify Integration
Automatic metadata enhancement makes data entry faster and more accurate:

- **Automatic Enhancement** - New songs are automatically enhanced with Spotify metadata, album art, and release year
- **Manual Enhancement** - Search Spotify for better matches and choose from multiple results
- **Playlist Import** - Import entire Spotify playlists with one click - just paste a playlist URL and all songs are imported with full metadata
- **Smart Metadata** - Automatically fetches album information, cover art, release years, and cleans up remaster tags

### ⚡ Bulk Operations
Efficiently manage multiple songs at once with powerful bulk editing:

- **Bulk Selection** - Select multiple songs across different packs for batch operations
- **Bulk Editing** - Change artist, album, year, pack assignment, or cover art for multiple songs simultaneously
- **Status Operations** - Move songs between statuses, mark as optional, or release entire packs
- **Spotify Operations** - Bulk enhance multiple songs with Spotify data or clean remaster tags
- **Pack-Level Actions** - Select entire packs at once for quick management

A collaborative community project where members contribute album-centric packs:
