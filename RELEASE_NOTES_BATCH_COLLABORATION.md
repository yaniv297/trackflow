**January 2026**

## Connecting Musicians Just Got Way Easier

We've completely reimagined how you discover and connect with fellow musicians on TrackFlow. Whether you're looking to collaborate on a single track or dive into an entire album project together, these new features make it faster and more intuitive than ever.

## 🔍 Your Musical Connections — Now More Powerful

The **Musical Connections** section has been expanded and redesigned to help you find your perfect collaborators at a glance.

### What's New:

**📐 Cleaner Layout**

- Shared Songs and Shared Artists now appear in dedicated sections, making it easier to scan through your connections
- Artist cards are organized in a clean 2-column grid with room to expand

**✅ Multi-Select & "Select All"**

- When you expand an artist connection, you can now **select multiple songs at once**
- Use the new **"Select All"** button to instantly select every available song from that artist
- Perfect for when you want to request collaboration on an entire discography match

**🚀 One-Click Batch Requests**

- Selected songs? Hit **"Send Request"** once to request collaboration on all of them
- No more clicking through individual modals — save time and reach out efficiently

## 📦 Batch Collaboration Requests

The biggest update to collaboration requests since launch.

### For Requesters:

**Send Multiple Requests at Once**

- Select multiple songs from the same owner (whether from Public WIP or Musical Connections)
- Send a single, consolidated request with one personalized message
- Your request appears as a grouped item — clean and organized

**Smart Selection Enforcement**

- TrackFlow ensures all selected songs belong to the same owner
- If you accidentally select from different owners, we'll guide you back on track

### For Recipients:

**Streamlined Inbox**

- Batch requests appear as a single grouped notification: _"User X wants to collaborate on 6 songs"_
- No more inbox clutter from individual requests

**Flexible Response Options**

- **Approve All** — Accept every song in the batch with one click
- **Decline All** — Politely pass on the entire request
- **Expand & Customize** — Review each song individually and make selective decisions
- Partial approvals are fully supported with clear status tracking

## 🎁 NEW: Grant Full Pack Permissions

When approving a collaboration request, you now have a powerful new option.

### How It Works:

When someone requests access to a song that's part of a pack (album series, EP, etc.), you can check **"Grant Full Pack Permissions"** to give them access to the **entire pack** — not just the requested songs.

### Why You'll Love It:

- **Perfect for album projects** — If someone wants to collaborate on one track from your album, why not invite them to the whole thing?
- **Saves time** — No need for multiple back-and-forth requests
- **Clear communication** — The requester receives a notification clearly stating they now have full pack access

### Example:

> _"jphn approved your request and granted you full access to 'The Cure - Wish Album Series' pack (12 songs)"_

## 📱 Homepage Widget Updates

Your **Collaboration Invites** widget on the home page now properly displays batch requests as grouped items with quick actions:

- See the batch summary at a glance
- **Accept All** or **Decline All** directly from the widget
- Click **"See Details →"** to manage individual songs on the full Collaboration Requests page

---

## 🔔 Smarter Notifications

Notifications have been updated to give you complete clarity:

- Batch request notifications link directly to the Collaboration Requests page
- Approval notifications clearly state whether you received:
  - Access to specific songs
  - Full pack permissions
  - Partial approval (with details on which songs)
