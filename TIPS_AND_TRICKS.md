# TrackFlow Tips & Tricks

A collection of obscure features, power user tips, and hidden functionality in TrackFlow.

## 🎯 Workflow & Progress Features

### Auto-completion of New Workflow Steps

When you add a new step to your workflow, TrackFlow automatically marks it as complete for songs that already had all previous steps finished. This means if you're 100% done with a song and add a new step, it won't suddenly show as incomplete.

### Workflow Inheritance for Collaborators

When you collaborate on someone else's song, you automatically use the song owner's workflow, not your own. This ensures everyone is aligned on what needs to be done.

### Reset to Default Workflow

If you've customized your workflow too much, you can reset it to the default template from the workflow settings page.

### Pack Priority System

Packs have a priority field (1-5 scale, where 5 is highest). You can set priorities to organize your workflow and sort by them.

### Optional Songs Don't Count Toward Completion

Mark songs as "optional" to exclude them from pack completion calculations. Perfect songs you're unsure about including.

### Cross-Pack Bulk Selection

You can select songs from multiple different packs simultaneously for bulk operations. This works on the Future Plans and Released pages.

### Pack-Level Selection

Use the pack header checkbox to select all songs in a pack at once for quick bulk operations.

## 🎵 Song Management Hacks
